# Comparing Go's Speed

Go is *generally* faster and more lightweight than interpreted or VM-powered languages like:

* Python
* JavaScript
* PHP
* Ruby
* Java

However, in terms of execution speed, Go does lag behind some other compiled languages like:

* C
* C++
* Rust

Go is a bit slower mostly due to its automated memory management, also known as the "Go runtime".
Slightly slower speed is the price we pay for memory safety and simple syntax!
